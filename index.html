        <p>This website is under the operation of MCA Intelifunds Ltd, trading as FXORO.</p>
        <p>MCA INTELIFUNDS LTD, trading as “FXORO”, is a financial services company incorporated and registered under
            the laws of
            the Republic of Cyprus, licensed and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) with

            eligibility.</p>
        <p>Risk disclaimer</p>
        <p>CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 75.28% of
            retail
            investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you
            understand how CFDs
            work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.
        </p>
        <p>The National Securities Market commission of Spain (the “CNMV”) has determined that, due to the complexity of
            CFDs and
            the risks involved, the purchase of such a product by Retail Clients is not appropriate/suitable. In this
            respect,
            pursuant to the relevant requirements introduced by CNMV, you are warned that you are about to purchase a
            product that
            is complex and difficult to understand: Contracts for Differences (CFDs). CNMV has determined that, due to
            its
            complexity and the risks involved, the purchase of this product by retail investors is not
            appropriate/suitable.</p>
        <p>Because of such, CFDs may not be the ideal investment for everyone. The high rate of leverage that is
            available to CFD
            traders can work for or against you. You should only invest money that you can afford to lose. CFDs are
            intricate
            leveraged financial assets. Trading Forex, Commodities, Indexes and Shares based CFDs, or any other
            underlaying
            instruments of the Company implies a high degree of risk and can lead to the loss of your investment. Before
            getting
            involved with trading, consider your financial goals, your skills and gage the possible risks associated
            with trading
            Company’s Products. Derivate assets like CFDs and likely instruments from other markets can present extreme
            volatility.
            CFDs may shift price rapidly and may depict change in market conditions that result from unforeseeable
            occurrences. None
            of these facts can be manipulated by either you or FXORO. It is best to consult with a licensed financial
            counselor.

            clear picture of the risks inherent with trading Company’s Products.</p>
